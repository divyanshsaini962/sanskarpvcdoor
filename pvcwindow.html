        <h1>PVC Casement Windows</h1>
        <p>Start by introducing PVC casement windows. Mention that they are a popular type of window made
             from polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a durable and low-maintenance material. Highlight their benefits,
              such as energy efficiency, noise reduction, and enhanced security.
            <br>
            <br>
            Window Design: <br>
            Describe the design of PVC casement windows. Explain that they are hinged at the side and open 
            outward like a door, operated by a crank mechanism. Discuss how this design allows for maximum 
            ventilation and easy cleaning, as the entire window can swing open.

                  Architectural Appeal: <br>
                  Emphasize the architectural appeal of bay and bow windows. Discuss how they create a sense of depth
                   and dimension, adding character and visual interest to a building's façade. Explain that their
                    projecting design can enhance the exterior architecture, making the structure more aesthetically
                     pleasing.

                Interior Space and Natural Light:<br>
                Discuss the impact of bay and bow windows on the interior space. Explain that their protruding 
                structure creates additional floor space, allowing for cozy seating areas, reading nooks, or 
                decorative displays. Highlight how the large expanse of glass in these windows enables ample 
                natural light to enter, brightening up the room and creating a welcoming atmosphere.

                <h1>PVC Tilt and Turn Windows</h1>
                <p>Begin by introducing tilt and turn windows as a modern and innovative window design. Explain that they 
                    are known for their dual functionality, allowing the window to tilt inwards for ventilation or open
                     fully like a casement window. Highlight their advantages, such as ease of cleaning, enhanced security,
                      and versatile ventilation options.

                     <br>
                     Window Design: <br>
                     Describe the design of tilt and turn windows. Explain that they typically consist of a single sash
                      that can be operated in two ways: tilting inward from the top for controlled ventilation or opening
                       fully from the side like a casement window. Discuss how this design allows for flexibility 
                       in airflow and ease of access for cleaning.

                      <br>
                      Versatile Ventilation Options:<br>
                      Highlight the ventilation options provided by tilt and turn windows. Explain that the tilting function 
                      allows for secure ventilation, even when the window is partially open. Discuss how this feature is
                       particularly useful in situations where direct outside airflow is desired, but security or safety
                        concerns exist.

                    <br>
                    Easy Cleaning and Maintenance:<br>
                    Emphasize the convenience of cleaning and maintaining tilt and turn windows. Explain that the inward tilt
                     function allows for easy access to both sides of the glass from the inside, making cleaning a hassle-free
                      task. Discuss how this feature is especially beneficial for upper floors or hard-to-reach areas.
