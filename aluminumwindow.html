    <h1>What is Aluminium window</h1>
    <p>
      Aluminum windows are windows that are constructed using aluminum as the main material for the window frames.
      Aluminum is a lightweight and durable metal that is commonly used in various construction applications, 
      including windows and doors.
       <br>
       <br>
       Aluminum windows offer several benefits due to the properties of the material. They are known for their 
       strength, corrosion resistance, and ability to withstand various weather conditions. These windows are 
       often chosen for both residential and commercial buildings.
       <br>
       <br>
       Aluminum window frames can be designed in various styles, such as casement, sliding, awning, and fixed 
       windows. They can also be customized with different finishes and colors to match the architectural 
       aesthetics of a building.
       <br>
       <br>
       One of the notable features of aluminum windows is their sleek and modern appearance. They can accommodate
       large glass panels, allowing for plenty of natural light to enter indoor spaces and providing unobstructed 
       views. Additionally, aluminum windows can be equipped with thermal breaks and insulating materials to 
       improve their energy efficiency and thermal performance.
        <br>
        <br>
        Aluminum windows require relatively low maintenance, and they are favored for their durability and 
        longevity. They are often used in locations where there's exposure to harsh weather conditions or
         where a contemporary design aesthetic is desired.
